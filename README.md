## Fakebook:
- This will be a Social Media site that is effectively
a recreation of FaceBook called FakeBook.


- So far we have a pretty much working site with posts, friends and friend-requests, next we are looking to implement:
  1. Friend reccomendations (maybe with machine learning)
  2. Messaging your friends
  3. Ways to update/delete your personal data (currently this is only the users name)
  4. Email password resets
  5. Tidy up some of the backend/css
  6. End-to-end encryption (At the moment only the passwords/2fa keys are secure
